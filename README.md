# Power BI Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that analyzes **sales performance, customer segmentation, and product insights** over multiple years.  
The dataset powering this dashboard is sourced from a **custom-built Data Warehouse**, which I previously developed as part of an ETL pipeline project.

## ðŸ—‚ Data Model
The Power BI model is built on **Star Schema** principles:
- **Fact Table**: `FactSales` â€“ contains transactional data such as sales amount, order quantity, and dates
- **Dimensions**:
  - `Product_View` â€“ product details, category, performance segmentation, lifespan
  - `Customer_View` â€“ customer details, segmentation, and behavior patterns

The **Fact Table** acts as the central table to establish relationships between dimensions in Power BI.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this dashboard was extracted from **SQL Views** and the **Fact Table**:

**Export Method**: Data was extracted from SQL Server using `SELECT *` statements and exported as CSV files.
